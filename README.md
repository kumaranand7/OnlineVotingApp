The Online Voting System is an Android application developed in Android Studio, utilizing an SQLite database as the backend. The primary objective of this system is to create an online voting platform that functions similarly to an online reservation system. It allows citizens who are 18 years of age or older to vote online without having to visit a physical polling booth.

## :rocket: Features 

- **Online Voting**: Citizens can vote from the convenience of their homes through the Android application.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes SQLite as the backend database for storing user information.

## :mag: How it Works

1. When a citizen uses the online voting system, their information is authenticated with the data present in the centralized Election Commission of India database.
2. If the user's information is not in the database, they will not be allowed to use the online voting system.
3. Citizens above the age of 18 can securely cast their votes online through the application.

## :wrench: Technologies Used

- Android Studio
- SQLite
